# script_system_optimizer



To add a **CPU usage optimizer** to the system optimization scripts, we need to implement measures that can either:

1. **Identify and stop processes** that are consuming excessive CPU.
2. **Optimize system settings** to balance CPU usage or prioritize certain tasks.
3. **Monitor CPU usage** and take corrective actions based on high utilization.

While **CPU optimization** isn't as straightforward as other system optimizations (e.g., disk cleanup), we can create a strategy that involves:

- **Listing high CPU-consuming processes**.
- **Killing unnecessary high-CPU processes** (optional, but useful if the processes are deemed non-essential).
- **Prioritizing CPU for certain tasks** (setting CPU affinity or adjusting priority, though these methods are usually for advanced scenarios).

We will integrate this into both the **PowerShell** (Windows) and **Bash** (Linux/macOS) scripts. The CPU usage optimizer will:

1. Identify high CPU-consuming processes.
2. Optionally, stop or lower the priority of high-CPU processes.
3. Provide system performance statistics for review.


### **Explanation of Changes:**

1. **PowerShell Script**:
    - **CPU Usage Optimization**: The script now checks for processes using the most CPU using `Get-Process`, sorts them in descending order, and selects the top 5 highest CPU-consuming processes.
    - **Optional Termination of Processes**: You can optionally terminate the highest CPU-consuming process by uncommenting the `Stop-Process` line (be cautious when using this in a production environment as it may kill critical system processes).
    - The CPU processes are displayed in a table for easier review.

2. **Bash Script**:
    - **CPU Usage Optimization**: The script uses the `top` command to display the top 20 processes by CPU usage.
    - **Optional Process Termination**: We use `kill -9` to terminate the highest CPU-consuming process by extracting the PID from `top` and killing it. This part is commented out by default, but you can uncomment it if you want the script to automatically kill high-CPU processes.

### **How to Use:**

1. **Run the Python Script**:
   - Save the Python script to a file (e.g., `generate_optimization_scripts.py`).
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python generate_optimization_scripts.py
     ```

2. **Generated Scripts**:
   - **Windows**: A PowerShell script (`system_optimization.ps1`) will be generated with disk cleanup, performance monitoring, CPU usage optimization, and a port scan.
   - **Linux/Mac**: A Bash script (`system_optimization.sh`) will be generated with system optimization tasks, including CPU usage monitoring and optimization, along with a port scan.

3. **Running the Scripts**:
   - **For PowerShell (Windows)**:
     - Right-click and select "Run with PowerShell" or run it from the PowerShell terminal:
       ```powershell
       ./system_optimization.ps1
       ```

   - **For Bash (Linux/Mac)**:
     - Make the script executable and run it:
       ```bash
       chmod +x system_optimization.sh
       ./system_optimization.sh
       ```

### **Important Notes**:

1. **CPU Usage Monitoring**:
    - The CPU usage optimizer checks for high CPU usage processes and provides the option to terminate them.
    - **Be careful** when killing processes, as terminating essential system processes can cause instability. Always verify which processes are safe to kill.

2. **nmap**:
    - Ensure `nmap` is installed on Linux/macOS for the port scan feature to work. Use the following commands if it's not installed:
      ```bash
      sudo apt install nmap   # Debian/Ubuntu
      brew install nmap       # macOS
      ```

3. **Permissions**:
    - Running these scripts may require elevated privileges (`sudo` on Linux/macOS or **administrator privileges** on Windows) for tasks like system updates, stopping services, and killing processes.

4. **Customizing CPU Optimization**:
    - You can modify the script to optimize for specific use cases. For example, you can adjust the threshold for "high CPU usage" or use `nice` (on Linux) to adjust process priorities instead of killing them.

### **Conclusion**:
This updated Python script generates **PowerShell** and **Bash** scripts that now include CPU usage optimization. These scripts check for high CPU-consuming processes, optionally terminate them, and provide a performance summary. They also retain the original functionality for disk cleanup, system updates, port scanning, and more.
